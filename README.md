# (my-gen AKA) gen

![logo](./doc/logo.png)

**gen** is a simple, command runner for Node.js. It interprets a custom DSL to automate file operations, variable management, shell commands, and conditional logic for project scaffolding and scripting tasks. Why not use Bash, Python, Make, or Just...? Because it is fun to create a new language and a new tool! ðŸ˜„

## Scope
- Parse and execute a custom DSL for project generation and scripting
- Support for variables, user input, file and folder operations, HTTP requests, and shell commands
- Extensible with new commands
- Designed for automation, scaffolding, and scripting in Node environments

## Usage

Install globally:
```bash
npm install -g my-gen
```
Create a `.gen` file with a list of commands and use like this:
```bash
gen --file <path/to/your.gen> --output <path/to/output/dir>
```

- `--file`: Path to the `.gen` script to execute (Default: current directory).
- `--output`: Optional path to the directory where commands will be executed. (Default: current directory)
- `--config`: Optional path to a JSON file to pre-populate the context.
- `--verbose`: Optional path to enable verbose logging.
- `--doc`: Convert the `.gen` file to markdown documentation.
- `--list`: List available templates from the repository.
- `--template=<name>`: Download and execute a template from the repository.

## .gen file SYNTAX & DSL Example
**.gen** file contains commands line by line based on a simple custom Domain Specific Language.

## Supported Commands

| Command    | Syntax Example                                 | Description                                                                                 |

| [`@log`](doc/commands/log.md)       | `@log Hello, world!`                           | Print a message to the console (supports variable interpolation)                            |

| [`@if`](doc/commands/if.md)         | `@if exists path`<br>`@if var is "value"`<br>`@if var isnot "value"` | Conditionally execute child commands based on file existence or variable comparison           |
| [`@loop`](doc/commands/loop.md)     | `@loop item in listVar`                        | Iterate over an array variable, setting `item` and executing child commands                 |
| [`@import`](doc/commands/import.md) | `@import ./other.gen`                           | Import and execute commands from another .gen file at that point in the script              |
| [`@task`](doc/commands/task.md)     | `@task taskname`                               | Define a named task that groups commands until the next empty line. When tasks are present in a file, shows a selection menu to choose which task to execute |

## Documentation Generation

The `--doc` flag allows you to convert `.gen` files into readable markdown documentation. This is useful for:
- Creating project setup guides, blog articles
- Documenting automation scripts
- Sharing project templates with clear instructions
```bash
# transform a .gen file to markdown documentation
gen --file=path/to/your/script.gen --doc
```

## Template Management

The tool provides built-in access to pre-made templates from the repository, making it easy to bootstrap new projects quickly.

### List Available Templates
View all available templates with descriptions:
```bash
gen --list
```

This command fetches the latest templates from the GitHub repository and displays them with their descriptions (extracted from the first comment in each `.gen` file).

### Execute Templates
Download and execute a template directly:
```bash
# Basic usage
gen --template=fastify --output=./my-api

# With custom configuration
gen --template=node-ts --config=myconfig.json --output=./my-project

# Using verbose logging
gen --template=react-shad --output=./my-app --verbose
```

**Template execution workflow:**
1. Downloads the specified template from `LorenzoCorbella74/my-gen/templates`
2. Executes it immediately in the specified output directory
3. Supports all standard options (`--config`, `--output`, `--verbose`)
4. Automatically cleans up temporary files after execution

**Error handling:**
- If template doesn't exist, shows available templates
- Network errors are handled gracefully
- Templates are downloaded to temporary directories and cleaned up automatically

### Available Templates
Use `gen --list` to see the current list of available templates, including:
- **node-ts**: Simple TypeScript project setup
- **fastify**: Fastify + TypeScript API project
- **react-shad**: React project with ShadCN UI
- **ink-ts**: CLI application with Ink framework
- And many more...

## Parse Folder to produce Template!
It is possibile **to transform a folder to a .gen template** thanks to the `--parse <folder>` option. It will create a `template.gen` file in the current working directory excluding some common folders like `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`. Do you want to parse a project folder created with vite and then customised and transform it to a `.gen` template? Just run:
```bash
gen --parse C:/DEV/template_vanilla_ts/vite-project
```

## Syntax Highlights VSCode Extension for .gen files
You can get the extension from [gen-vsc-extension](https://github.com/LorenzoCorbella74/gen-vsc-extension) and install it in your VSCode extension panel by choosing "Install from VSIX..." and selecting the downloaded `gen-vsc-extension-0.0.1.vsix` file.

### Using with GitHub Copilot
When working in VS Code with GitHub Copilot:
1. Open the `AGENTS.md` file in your workspace
2. Reference it in your prompts: *"Using the AGENTS.md guide, create a .gen script for a React TypeScript project with testing setup"*
3. Copilot will use the DSL documentation to generate appropriate `.gen` scripts
4. You can also reference existing templates: *"Create a template similar to the fastify template but for Express"*

### Using with Gemini CLI
For command-line AI assistance:
```bash
# Include the agents guide in your prompt
gemini "Based on the AGENTS.md file in this project, create a .gen script that sets up a Node.js Express API with MongoDB integration"

# Reference existing templates
gemini "Look at the available templates with 'gen --list' and create a new template for Vue.js projects"
```

### Using with Other AI Tools
The `AGENTS.md` file can be used as context with any AI coding assistant:
- **Claude**: Upload the file as an attachment for comprehensive DSL understanding
- **ChatGPT**: Copy relevant sections into your conversation for script generation
- **Cursor**: Reference the file for intelligent `.gen` script completions

You can also use `gen --list` to show AI assistants the available templates as examples for creating new ones.

This approach ensures consistent, well-structured `.gen` files that follow DSL best practices and leverage all available commands effectively.

## Examples
Look inside the folder [templates](./templates/) for ready-to-use `.gen` scripts and templates.

# Future Plans
- [x] reorganize the STDOUT and STDERR with ink.js(Terminal-Kit or Neo-Blessed or Charsm...) / console interattiva
- [x] improve how it works globally (WINDOWS, LINUX, MAC)
- [x] understand how to extend with new commands "from outside" (plugin systems )
